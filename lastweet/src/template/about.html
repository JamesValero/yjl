<h1>About</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>Basically, this application can tell you how long you have been talking to your friends. You actually do not need to check here, you can <a href="/subscribe">subscribe</a> via email.</p>

<h2>Updating</h2>
<h3>How soon will Last Tweets update an account?</h3>
<p>Last Tweets doesn't automatically update an account. Unless someone checks an account 24 Hours later after last updated, or an account is subscribed.</p>

<h3>What does "Pinging system is temporarily offine" mean?</h3>
<p>Because of Google App Engine's limitation and the time of data retrieving, Last Tweets has to process a request of checking by small piece at a time. Therefore, once a while a <b>Pinging System</b> will ping Last Tweets, let it know it's time to process. However, currently, I don't have a computer can stay online 24 hours a day, which means you have to wait me waking up and turning on my computer. If you have a computer can stay online 24/7 and you are willing share small resource from that computer, please give me a message <a href="http://twitter.com/livibetter">@livibetter</a> (Windows, Mac, or Linux all are ok).</p>

<h2>Subscription</h2>
<h3>When will Last Tweets send mail?</h3>
<p>If there are a) a friend you never sent a message or b) a friend you have not sent in last 14 days; and at least 14 days after last time sent.</p>

<h2>Magpie Detection</h2>
<h3>How accurate is the detection</h3>
Maybe not high enough. Those Magpie ads doesn't have client source, e.g. Twhirl, Twitterfox, etc. Therefore I can only see if the first word of tweet is <b>#magpie</b> and if there is <b>http://</b>. Please must read the suspicious tweets before you take more further actions.

<h3>Why add this?</h3>
I don't like it. However, I haven't seen any Magpie ads in my stream (I don't follow many people). In my opinion, it would not be a totally bad thing IF the followers of that account can have choices besides UNFOLLOWING in order to get rid of those ads. So far, it's bad.

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Twitter account must not be protected, but not limit to friends. If you twitter account is protected, Last Tweets can't retrieve updates.</li>
  <li>Only first 100 friends will be checked.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Server things</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Once Last Tweets finishes updating for an account, it tries to mail if that account is subscribed and have not mailed in last 14 days.</li>
  <li>Up to one searching request to Twitter a second, means 100 friends need 100 seconds to check them all, and that is the ideal case.</li>
  <li>Every 10 minutes, Last Tweets tries to mail for those failed to mail last time.</li>
  <li>Every an hour, Last Tweets automatically queues those accounts have been subscribed and last mailed more than 14 days.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sucks!</h2>
